 * A {@link FlowRateUnit} is an abstraction of a {@link ChronoUnit} which leverages Java's built-in {@code enum}
 * functionality to create a slightly more efficient map of unit names to functional unit instances.

 * I suppose the translation here is that this is a combination of a weird hack and possibly pointless optimization
 * made to achieve a simple lookup table for parsing. Meh. Wouldn't need to do this if Java supported reasonable
 * parsing for {@link ChronoUnit}s.
